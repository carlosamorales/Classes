# 📖 Create a New GitHub Repository

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a new GitHub repository and add an HTML file to it.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a new repository named `first-day-repo` using the GitHub user interface.

* It's done when I have cloned the `first-day-repo` to my local machine.

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to navigate into the `first-day-repo` directory.

* It's done when I have used command-line commands to create an `index.html` file.

* It's done when I add and commit my changes using Git commands.

* It's done when I push the changes to the remote repository.

## 💡 Hints

What command can you use to list the contents of a directory? How can you use this command to check your work?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the `git fetch` and `git merge` commands? 

 `git fetch`  
  git fetch is a Git command used to retrieve changes from a remote repository without automatically merging them into your working branch. It allows you to fetch updates made by others in the remote repository, providing you with information about changes without modifying your local working copy.
 `git merge`
  git merge is a Git command used to combine changes from different branches. It allows you to merge the changes made in one branch into another. The primary use case for git merge is to integrate feature branches or topic branches back into the main branch, such as merging a feature branch into the main branch.
